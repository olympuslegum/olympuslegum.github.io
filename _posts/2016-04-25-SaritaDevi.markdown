On October 1, 2015 Laishram Sarita Devi, 5 time Asian championship gold medalist and 3 times world championship medalist, completed one year of suspension imposed upon her by International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) for insubordination.

<blockquote>
She was barred from participating in any national or international event from October 1, 2014 besides being fined 1000 swiss francs. AIBA had provisionally suspended her for refusing to accept the bronze medal at the Asian Games podium ceremony after losing to her South Korean opponent Jina Park in semi-final bout of which she felt was pre-determined.
</blockquote> 


Shocked by the suspension, entire nation came forward to support her. Cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar wrote a letter to the Union Sports Minister requesting him to ensure that her career is not terminated prematurely.


### WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?
After losing the first round decisively, Sarita came back firmly in the next. Judges B and C awarded the round 10-9 to the Indian. However, Judge A gave it 10-9 to the South Korean. It was in the third round when Indian ram shackled Park and controversy arose. Perplexingly, Judges B and C awarded the round 10-9 in favor of her opponent while Judge A gave the round 10-9 to Sarita.

In the fourth and conclusive round all the three judges awarded the round to the South Korean by 10-9 which was also a closed packed joust that made the way for the South Korean to the final. 

Besides Sarita AIBA also provisionally suspended Sarita's coaches as well as Indian chef-de-mission in the Inch eon Asiad.

This article attempts to examine the statute, rules, and competition rules and by-laws of AIBA and Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and of other bodies associated with the whole controversy and also where Indian entourage lacked or erred in dealing with the entire controversy.

Boxing was included in Olympic movement in 1904 at St Louis Games, United States. AIBA, founded in 1924, is sanctioned by International Olympic Committee (IOC) to organize amateur (Olympic style) boxing all over the world. 

### Decoding of AIBA Statute and Rules

Article 60.1 of AIBA Statute allows AIBA to operate and manage all AIBA controlled AIBA Open Boxing (AOB) Competitions-which Asian Games boxing competition is part of. Article 4 empowers AIBA to make competition rules and ensure their enforcement in all competitions organized by AIBA, its confederation and any National Federation. Article 6 makes it mandatory for all Confederations, National Federations and Boxers to comply with AIBA Statute, its bylaws, and Code of Ethics and Disciplinary Code. 

Article 47.1 grants judicial status to Disciplinary Commission of AIBA which evaluated the protest of Sarita Devi. Article 64, read with article 69 of the statute, empowers Disciplinary Commission to decide all disciplinary measures in accordance with the AIBA Code of ethics or Disciplinary Code. Article 2.1 of AIBA Disciplinary Code extends jurisdiction of code to all national federations and their boxers. Article 9.1 of the code provides a list of sanctions to be imposed by Disciplinary Commission-suspension of the boxer is one of them. 

Further, Article 10 of constitution of Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) clearly says that Competition will be conducted under the International Federation (IF)’s technical Rules, which is in this case AIBA.
In presence of all these provisions it is clear that AIBA and its judicial body (Disciplinary Commission) had complete jurisdiction to exercise control over the controversial bout of Sarita Devi. 
Boxer left helpless

Soon after 'injustice' was served to her, Sarita and her husband urged for filing an official protest. Both waited for about an hour to decide how to register protest. within a couple of hours of filling the protest, reply  came with  AIBA supervisor's  “notice  of  protest  evaluation” which rejected the protest citing  Article 8.4  of the  AOB(AIBA Open Boxing)  competition  rules, which prohibit  protest  against  the  judges’  "decision ”. It implies that AIBA “judges" are beyond reprimand.

Here role of senior IOA (Indian Olympic Association) officials, <b>including secretary general and deputy chef- de –mission with the contingent, becomes questionable, as none of them offered assistance to the dilapidated boxer. Insensitivity was so heightened that boxer had to borrow 500 dollars, required as fee, to lodge the protest.<b>

None of the IOA officials present there chose to involve them in her plight.OCA Secretary General and Deputy Chef-de-Mission of Indian contingent left the venue soon after the bout. 

It shows blatant ignorance of rules and procedure on the part of Indian officials present with the contingent.IOA should have ensured that officials travelling with contingent are properly educated with the technical rules  and procedure related to the issues arising out of the games otherwise they have nothing to do there except free foreign trip on public exchequer. 

It is also in the interest of athletes if officials are well aware of rules and procedure governing any dispute arising in the game. 

Take the example of Nyambar, a Mongolian player. Like Sarita Devi he also lost to South Korean opponent. Large number of spectators who watched the game were of the opinion that he was winner but judges felt otherwise. Their Chef-de-mission reached the venue within minutes, raised the issue before the organizers and registered the protest. 

<blockquote>Clearly, there is an urgent need to arm our officials with knowledge of rules and procedure to handle such kind of crucial matters otherwise interests of sportspersons will be continuously jeopardized whom they claim to protect which also includes national honour at international events.</blockquote>> 

Another way of dealing with such situations may be that IOC (International Olympic Committee) and AIBA should allow national bodies to accompany lawyers with their contingent to deal with such kind of situations.

In January 2015, a petition was filed by a senior advocate in Delhi High Court seeking a direction to Boxing India (BI) to appeal against the AIBA decision. Affidavit stated that:

AIBA statute recognizes the jurisdiction of CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) in relation to any dispute covered by rules of the Olympic Charter and provides that any dispute in connection with Olympic Games will be exclusively decided by CAS (rule 61). This rule is equally applicable to the affairs of Asian Games, and therefore, decisions of the AIBA judicial authorities are inherently capable of being challenged in CAS. 
Contrary to this Boxing India contended that no action lies against the decision of AIBA.

Rule 61(2) of Olympic Games states that: "Any dispute arising on the occasion of, or in connection with, the Olympic Games shall be submitted exclusively to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), in accordance with the Code of Sports-Related Arbitration. 
Thus, it is clear that final decisions of the AIBA judicial authorities relating to a dispute are subject to an appeal to the CAS (Court for Arbitration in Sport) and stand of Boxing India (BI) in Delhi high court is false. Court disposed of plea observing that since no appeal has been filed by Boxing India (BI) against AIBA order the court cannot direct Boxing India (BI) to file an appeal.

This whole saga of timidity, thanks to the Boxing India (BI), and of arbitrariness by AIBA judges calls upon to question how loss befallen upon sportspersons will be compensated when they are suspended arbitrarily at prime of their career. Shouldn’t their "right to compensation" be recognized if they are punished wrongly? CAS (Court for Arbitration in Sport) must take suo moto cognizance of such kind of incidents. Also, it is incorrect to hold that competition jury's decision is unchallengeable. 

In 2012, London Olympic, Indian boxer Vikas Krishan was declared winner in 69 kg pre-quarterfinal bout against American boxer Errel Spence. Against this the American team filed a review citing the fouls perpetrated by Vikas Krishan which were not noticed by the referee. Consequently, AIBE overturned the result and the American boxer was declared winner.
