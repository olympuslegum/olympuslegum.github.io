In the complaint, it was alleged that both of these players were violating the newly implement BCCI's Conflict of Interest Policy under the category of retired cricketers as per <a href="www.BCCI.tv">BCCI.tv</a>, which stipulates that: -

Pradeep Amre was found in contravention to the rules of the conflict of Interest policy by holding dual posts as an assistant coach of the IPL’s Delhi Daredevils as well as an administrator with a BCCI affiliated unit. It was further alleged in the complaint that the position of Dilip Vengsarkar is also in contravention of the said rules. The accusation was found to be arbitrary as Vengsarkar runs a private cricket academy and is neither involved with the selection process nor is a coach with any of the BCCI affiliated organizations.
 
The ombudsman in his order with regards to Pradeep Amre directed the BCCI to complete their due diligence and not to commit such errors in the future.
