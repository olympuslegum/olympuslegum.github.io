<b>Zee Telefilms Ltd.</b> was delivered by constitutional bench. Zee telefilms had bid for the telecast rights of cricket tournaments which were cancelled by the BCCI .then Zee Telefilms filed a petition under article 32 against BCCI. The majority ruled that BCCI was not an instrumentality of the state. But the majority applying Pradeep Kumar Biswas qualified that:

1. Central  government  has been exercising certain control  over the activities of   the Board  in  regard  to organizing cricket  matches and  travel  of  the  Indian  team  abroad and granting permission  to allow  the  foreign  teams  to come  to  India. But this control is less than being administrative control. At best this is purely regulatory in nature devoid of pervasive state control of the Board.

2. Some duties  of the Board like  the selection of  an  Indian cricket team ,controlling  the activities of  the players and others  involved  in  the game of  cricket were akin  to public duties or  state  functions and in case of  any violation of constitutional  or  statutory  obligation or rights of citizens, the aggrieved party m ay  seek a remedy  by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of  the Constitution, which is much wider than Article 32.

<blockquote>
The question before the court was whether the  Board  would  come  under  the  expanded  meaning of  the  term  "other  authorities" in  Article  12 of the constitution  because it performs activities akin to public functions discharged by public bodies. 
</blockquote>

The basis of petitioner’s contention was the expansion of the scope of the term "other authorities” by the apex court in its various judgments. 

The Court applied the guidelines laid down in Pradeep Kumar Biswas's case (a seven Judge Bench judgment) for a body to be a State under Article 12 and concluded that:

There  is  no existence  o f  a  deep  and  pervasive  State  control .T he  control, if  any, is  only   regulatory in  nature  as  applicable  to   other  similar  bodies.   This control is not specifically   exercised under any special   statute applicable to   the Board.   Al l   functions  o f  the  Board  are  not  public  functions  nor  are they  closely  related to  governmental  functions.


In his dissenting judgement Justice S.B. Sinha said that BCCI's actions viz  promotion  of the sport ,making  laws  for cricket   for the entire country,  national representation  in  international   forums, appointment of   India's  representatives, and  the all-pervasive control  over  players, managers and umpires are all state actions.

In absence of any legislation the Board authorized itself as regulator of cricket in India.

Justice Sinha further said that a body which carries on the monopolistic function of selecting  team  to represent the nation and whose core function  is  to   promote  a  sport  that  has  become  a symbol   of  national   identity   and  a  medium  of  expression  of  national   pride,   must  be  held  to   be carrying out government function.

<blockquote>Justice  Sinha included BCCI in the description of “other authorities" in article 12 by tracing the nature of its activities and functions performed by it.</blockquote>

Its  activities  impinge  upon  the  fundamental  rights o f the players and other persons as  also  the rights  o f  the  cricket  loving public.  The  right  to   see  the game of  cricket  live  or  on  television forms  an  important  function of  the Board.   A  body   which  makes  a  law  for  the  sports  in  Indi a  (which otherwise  is  the  function  of  the State),  conferring   upon  itself  not  only   enormous  powers  but  also final say in  the  disciplinary matter and,  thus, being responsible  for making or marring a citizen's sports career, it would  be  an authority which  answers  the  description  of  other  authorities".

Justice Sinha also pointed out that the test laid down in Pradeep Biswas' case of a body controlled financially, functionally and administratively by the government is not applicable in the present case where BCCI was established long time back as a private body.


<b>A.C.Muthiah Case (2011)</b> grew out of a suit filed by A.C  Muthiah, a former president  of   the BCCI, against the  BCCI at Madras high court in September 2008.

The two judges’ bench at Supreme Court followed categorical observations made by the Constitution Bench in <b>Zee Telefilms Case</b> and firmly opined that <b>Netaji Cricket Club case</b> was “no longer good law".  In Netaji Cricket Club judgment, delivered by two judges’ bench, it was observed that:

… As a member of ICC, BCCI represents the country   in the international fora. It exercises enormous public functions.   It has  the  authority   to select  players,   umpires and  officials  to   represent  the  country   in  the  international  fora.   It exercises total   control over the players,   umpires and other officers.   The  Rules  of  the  Board  clearly demonstrate  that  without  its  recognition  no   competitive  cricket  can  be  hosted  either within  or outside the country .  Its control over the sport of competitive cricket is deeply pervasive and complete. (Para 80)

In  law, there  cannot  be  any   dispute  that  having  regard  to   the  enormity   of  power exercised by  it,  the Board is bound to  follow the doctrine of "fairness" and "good faith" in all  its activities.  Having regard to the fact that  it has to  fulfill  the  hopes  and  aspirations  of millions,   it  has  a  duty   to   act  reasonably .   It cannot act arbitrarily, whimsically   or capriciously.   As  the  Board  controls  the  profession  of  cricketers,   its  actions  are  required to  be judged and viewed by  higher standards."(Para 81)

These observations compels to ponder over the functions and working of  the board when it acts as ultimate authority upon every aspect of governance of cricket as a sport in India-whether it be rule making, management, policy formulation, organization of competitive tournaments attended by thousand of thousands people ,sending team in the territory of extra-jurisdiction of India and what not. 

Muthiah alleged conflict of interest against N.Srinivasan saying since he was the Managing Director of India Cements Limited, one of the franchisee o f IPL and  IPL being  an  event  of  BCCI ,he had  thereby   acquired  commercial interest  and violated  the terms  o f  Clause  6.2.4  of  the  Regulations. Subsequently Srinivasan participated in the annual general meeting of BCCI, in Mumbai   on September 27, 2008 wherein he was elected Secretary of BCCI. on  the  same  day  an  amendment  in  Clause  6.2.4  of  the  Regulations  for  players, team  officials, managers,   etc. ,   was  made to conceal the petition of conflict of interest . Amended Clause 6.2.4 provided as under: -
<blockquote>
"No   administrator  shall   have  directly   or  indirectly   any   commercial   interest  in  the matches  or  events  conducted  by   BCCI   excluding  events  like  IPL  or  Champions  League Twenty  20."
</blockquote>

When matter reached the apex court, Justice Panchal relied on majority judgment in Zee Telefilms Ltd and held BCCI not to be part of state with in the purview of article 12 of constitution.

<b>BCCI CASE (2015)</b> arose out of two writ petitions filed by cricket association of Bihar before the Bombay high court. One of the issues framed for determination was whether BCCI is ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 and if it is not, whether it is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India? 

The court went through scores of judgments of its several benches and other foreign judgments and <b>held that BCCI performs important public functions similar to state function. it can be held liable under article 226 of the constitution of India  not article 32 even not being state within the meaning of article 12.Court recognized that some duties performed  by BCCI  like the Selection of Indian Cricket Team, controlling the activities of the players are akin to public duties or State functions.</b> 

Detailing various functions of the board –complete control and regulation over the game to the exclusion of others, formulation of rules, regulation norms and standards regarding all aspects of game, power to choose national team, selling of broadcasting and telecast rights the Court concluded that its functions are patently in public domain eligible to be acquired by the government. 

One way of achieving this can be enactment of legislation according to the provisions of article 249 of the constitution wherein parliament has the power to make law on a matter of national importance.

The basis for decision in <b>BCCI CASE (2015)</b> is 'Character of function and duties' test which can have many   implications for other sports bodies like National Sports Federations (NSFs) and other similar bodies. 

NSFs are autonomous bodies tracing their authority to parent national organization. Indian Olympic Association (IOA) performs the role of National Olympic Committee (NOC) as per the provisions of Olympic charter. The Charter instructs IOA to preserve its autonomy and resist all pressures of any kind be it political, legal, religious or economic.  (Ch.27 mission and role of National Olympic Committee, 6)

In December 2012, it was embarrassing for us when International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended Indian Olympic Association (IOA) for fourteen months because of government’s interference. IOA had conducted elections under government's sport code in adherence of the order of Delhi high court thereby violating the IOC's fiat to hold elections under the Olympic charter. We are not the only country to face the suspension by the world sports governing body. South Africa was suspended  for  its apartheid policy while Kuwait  faced the same fate for government  interference before  it was  re-admitted  after it's Olympic  body amended  its  constitution. The Netherlands Antilles, an island country in the Caribbean, and South Sudan were also suspended for not forming their national Olympic Committees.

Since IOA enjoys control over state Olympic associations and national sports federations (NSFs) therefore they also resist any government pressure upon them. Another line of argument is that all these sports bodies receive government aids in myriad forms ranging from tax benefits (as in the case of BCCI) to financial assistance (as in the case of NSFs).moreover, IOA has been declared as a public authority under the Right to Information Act, 2005 by the High Court of Delhi on January 7, 2010.
