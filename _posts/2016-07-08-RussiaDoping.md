Weeks before the Rio Summer Olympics 2016, the Russian Olympic Committee has challenged the IAAF’s ban on Russian athletes in Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS), Laussane, Switzerland. The IAAF’s committee in a vote affirmed the ban last month.  The Russian Olympic committee (ROC) spokesperson Konstantin Vybronov confirmed the associated press through an email, that an appeal has been filled against the IAAF’s judgment in the CAS and the hearing is schedule on 19th of July, 2016.

In a press release given by the court of arbitration of sports (CAS) stated that, “On 13 November 2015, the IAAF suspended the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF) from IAAF membership. Such suspension was confirmed on 26 November 2015 and on 17 June 2016. Pursuant to <b>Rule 22.1</b> of the IAAF Competition Rules, athletes whose National Federation is suspended by the IAAF are ineligible for competitions held under the IAAF Rules. “

Further the press release also stated that, In their request for arbitration, “the ROC and the 68 athletes request the CAS in particular to review the validity, enforceability and scope of IAAF Competition <b>Rules 22.1(a) and 22.1A,</b> and to order that any Russian athlete who is not currently the subject of any period of ineligibility for the commission of an anti-doping rule violation may participate at the 2016 Olympic Games (subject to meeting the qualification standards for his or her event).”

ROC’s legal department head, Alexandra Brilliantova told the TASS NEWS agency that, if Russia wins the appeal the Olympics application deadline would be extended. As if for now, only 2 athletes out of 80 are eligible as per the mandate of IAAF for participation in the said event.

Earlier, <b>Yulia Stepanova</b>, the whistleblower who blew the lit against the widespread state sponsored doping had been approved of participation in the Olympics representing as a <b>“neutral athlete “</b> meaning not representing a particular country.

In an attempt for image makeover, the European Athletics during the European championship have raised a campaign, “I run clean, I jump clean and I throw clean,” which the athletes are supposed to wear as a bib during the championships.
