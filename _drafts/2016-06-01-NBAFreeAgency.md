After Cleveland won the NBA finals (2015-16) the next speculations was about the free agency were franchisees offering big money due to excessive salary cap, came true. With players like Kevin Durrant, Mike Conelly and Al Horford in the play there are certain mediocre players like Kent Bazemoore, Hassan Whiteside (already signed with the Heat) and Timothy Mozgov (Signed with the Lakers for $64 million), Chandler Parsons (Signed with the Grizzlies) and Dwight Howard to name a few would be benefiting with the extended cap size. There are certain undrafted players such as Jeremy Lin who have also benefited of their hard work by signing a deal with the Brooklyn nets for $36 million for a span of three years. So is the NBA’s wild-wild west theory criticized during the 90’s with Kevin Garnett being offered a major chunk of the salary and the heavily criticized contracts of Alonzo Mourning and Shaquille O Neal $100 million dollar getting a <b>legitimized</b> node of the market? Absolutely yes, earlier there was not enough cap space so the players of the lower strata or relatively mediocre strata used to suffer with the lower priced contracts. Now, not just the star players can make their enough dough but the average players can make a major chunk of the same dough. More likely putting the both stream at par as, <b>“Cut from the same cloth in terms of money.”</b> Talent will be regardless at this moment or point of time or hardly of any relevance.

### The new TV deal worth $24 Billion

It is worth noting that all this chaos of money came from the whopping $24 Billion deal signed by the NBA with Turner sports Broadcasting Inc and Walt Disney agreeing to a 9 year deal ending in 2025.  As the deal was signed in the season 2014-15 a cap infusion of $6 million took place as Basketball Related Income (BRI) and further the same infusion came in the year 2015-16 giving a higher cap space to the franchisees in order to retain or add players on their pay roll.

Now, with the cap infusion as the TV deal enters into action almost every franchisee or 2/3rd of the league has an option of accommodating a Max Contract player or an above average player offering them max contracts of worth $94 million as per the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or player signing yearly contract with player option with a maximum of each years $24 million- $27.5 Million (The same has been followed by Lebron James at Cleveland Cavaliers). It will be interesting and noteworthy to further keep an eye on the Collective Bargaining agreement as it is expiring with the end of the 2016-17 season where the NBPA will be deciding to stay within or opt out of the running CBA before 15th of December.

### What the players can do?

Keeping in mind the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement with the 2016-17 season there are two things. Signing yearly contracts with player option as at the end of every season the player gets an opportunity of signing a Max deal if you are a Max Contract calibrated player and thus wait for the tide to turn for more money with a new collective bargain in place in 2017. With the player services of upto less then 10 years are based upon the CBA and NBPA mandate of the 30 % of the salary cap or 105% of the last seasons salary which every is higher or on adding more then 10 or 10 years to an organization, a new contract can be signed on a 35% of the salary cap or 105% of the last salary, which ever is higher. But it will be a heavy bet to place your cards on the table so as to which knows what is going to happen on the negotiation tables and what cards will the NBPA and the ownership will be playing after the disastrous settlement of the 2011 lockout, when finally being on the negotiations table in 2017 if the NBPA opts out mid way December of 2016 for a new collective bargaining agreement. 

The second thing, which a player can do, is simple, to get cash rich by signing in max deals, which also removes discrepancies in terms of injuries as the current CBA protects every dollar that has been guaranteed in the contract so a max deal will definitely seal the future. 

Further, there can be a third option, if a player has been a part of an organization for 3 seasons and has not changed a team or being waived by an organization, in that case the player can be signed under the <b>Larry Bird exception rule</b> and will be beneficial to players who are looking for a limited period contract say a season, they are also called as <b>Birds free agents</b>.  The contract under the same would increase by 7.5% each year and if the same player opts out to a different team the same contract would increase by 4.5%. The Larry Bird exception also helps the franchisees in order to circumvent the luxury tax limit. So, a win-win for both the players as well as well as the organization, as it helps them further in recruiting major talents via further increase in the salary cap.

### Tax troubles for the players signing Max Contracts

As taxes being a state subject, every state has a different tax rates while some having a higher percentage, while the other relatively low. It would be pertinent to note that if a player is just thinking in terms of money, a lot can be made and a lot can be saved by signing in with the right team and in the right state. As mentioned by Prof Michael Mccann and Robert Riola in their article in Sports Illustrated. The team states have very different state taxes and vary right from the Celtics in the state of Massachusetts paying 5.1% state income tax to the state of California where the state taxes are as high as 13.3%. So if an average player or an above average player are nearing to close a max deal or a higher proportion of the salary cap with the kind of money which is being offered this free agency, the source of the money has to be kept in mind as most of the players don’t have a shoe deal to cover their part of a sizing pocket.

<blockquote>
Long story short, the team roasters will be made or destroyed as money being the <b>biggest gunslinger</b> in the helm. And the salary cap increased to $94 million per season there is a lot of money to be spent with a  staggering luxury tax cap at $111 million (Speculative). The problem is the organizations actually don’t know where to spend it all and the biggest winners will be the role players who are as essential as the Max contract player and with advent of time they all will be on the same verge of an equally competitive market and money being the biggest lure. Who says, despite of the lockouts in the past, that the NBA is not a cash rich league!
